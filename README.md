# Swarm & Zombie

v1.5

"Swarm & Zombie" is a small game inspired by the experimental project "Attack of the Killer Swarm." In this game, players must try to pick up zombies and splatter them.

To start playing, bite the "Dead Hand".

HINT: Use the mouse to set a goal for the swarm. The swarm will try to catch the goal, but they often fly too fast to stop near the target.

Made with LÖVE and some self-made libraries on top of the engine.
